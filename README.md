# ws1-notification-services-api

This repo contains the documentation on using the available APIs in the Workspace ONE Notification Service.

This repo is structured to feed into the developer.omnissa.com Developer Portal via the [](https://github.com/euc-dev/developer.omnissa.github.io) repo using MkDocs published by GitHub Pages. All documentation should be created in MarkDown format with the capabilities of MkDocs and the Material theme in mind under the /docs/sdks/ws1-sdk-uem-ios folder. This folder will be integrated into the [developer portal repo](https://github.com/euc-dev/developer.omnissa.github.io) when built using a GitHub Action.
